## 🧰 EQUIPMENTS REQUIRED
- Power supply  
- Fibre optic trainer kit  
- Patch chords  
- 1-meter fiber optic cable  
- Digital Storage Oscilloscope (DSO)

## 📚 THEORY

- **Attenuation** is the loss of power during transmission. Light pulses lose photons, reducing amplitude.
- Attenuation is measured in **decibels per kilometer (dB/km)**.
  - Premium small-core glass fibers: ~1 dB/km  
  - Large-core plastic fibers: up to 2000 dB/km  
- Loss is expressed as a negative decibel value, but commonly the sign is omitted.

### 📐 Attenuation Formula

\[
\alpha \ (\text{dB}) = 10 \cdot \log_{10} \left( \frac{P_i}{P_o} \right)
\]

Where:  
- \( \alpha \) = Loss in dB/m  
- \( P_i \) = Input power  
- \( P_o \) = Output power

## 🧪 PROCEDURE

### 🔧 Setup

1. Connect the power supply to the board.
2. Make the following connections:
   - Function generator’s 1 kHz sine wave output → Input 1 of emitter 1 via 4 mm lead  
   - 0.5 m optic fiber → emitter 1 output to detector 1 input  
   - Detector 1 output → amplifier 1 input via 4 mm lead  
3. Switch on the power supply.
4. Set Oscilloscope Channel 1 to 0.5 V/Div. Adjust amplitude to 4–6 divisions using X1 probe and variable potentiometer.
5. Observe output signal from detector TP10 on CRO.
6. Adjust received signal amplitude to match transmitted signal using gain potentiometer. Note this amplitude as **V₁**.
7. Replace the 0.5 m cable with a 1 m cable without changing other settings.
8. Measure the new amplitude at amplifier 1 output (TP28). Note this value as **V₂**.

### 📏 Attenuation Calculation

\[
\frac{V_1}{V_2} = e^{-\alpha (L_1 + L_2)}
\]

Where:  
- \( \alpha \) = Loss in nepers/m  
- \( 1 \ \text{neper} = 8.686 \ \text{dB} \)  
- \( L_1 = 0.5 \ \text{m} \), \( L_2 = 1 \ \text{m} \)

## 🔁 BENDING LOSS

1. Repeat steps 1–6 from the previous procedure.
2. Wind the fiber optic cable on a mandrel and observe the AC amplifier output on CRO. A reduction indicates bending loss.
3. Repeat with loose connections and different fiber lengths to observe variation.
